# SRGAN_tensorflow

### Introduction
This project is a tensorflow implementation of the impressive work  [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02470v1.pdf). <br />
The result on BSD100, Set14, Set5 will be reported later. The code is highly inspired by the [pix2pix-tensorflow](https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow).
 
### Denpendency
